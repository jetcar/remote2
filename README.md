Remote controll
Reads input from serial port and turns them into video player actions. Provide file explorer and some limited player controll.
Currently using with arduino ar IR receiver but can work with any IR device to play wideos on TV. 
Easy to teach remote controll signals by UI. First started with bsplayer, but then switched to vlc because it provide http interface so 
don't need to send keys and activate player window.
